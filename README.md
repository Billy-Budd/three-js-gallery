NOTES ON CURATOR CUSTOMIZATION:
frames:
- the frames are set to be a bit larger than originally intended. may remove when there is actual art from the collection, but it fits better like this for now

custom position:
- there are no safety bounds for this, and to be honest i dont feel like adding them because i feel like it should be 'on the student' whether or not they checked before turning in
