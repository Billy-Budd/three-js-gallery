important tasks:
- entry card update (css/html)
- cover photo (waiting for rachel)
- matte math for weighted bottom
- info card update (css)

medium importance:
- create loading screen
  - gallery can be slow to load, we can use a three js function to count loaded textures while camera does a 360 so that its smooth by the time you get in

waiting:
- ask frontend about outside sim editing (waiting on API)
  - saving json stuff, see below (waiting on API)

future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- how to incorporate with existing website. I think vaughan/donnie will know something about this but i feel bad about asking him how to do this

bugs: 
- shift movement bug: holding shift while using wasd to move can cause event listeners to not recognize that a key has been unpressed. this also causes the camera to begin moving in a direction, as well as move beyond the bounding box and leave the gallery entirely without being able to move back in. current fix: reload page, do not press shift. 
- fix the event listener problem (click to view): in Render.js, we create event listeners for when a photo is clicked. The issue is that it creates [the amount of times your machine can complete the render function in the amount of time a single click is registered]. This can create upwards of like 2-300 event listeners, causing lag. current fix: none

RAMBLING NOTES:

math:: [size of matte - height of art] / 4
take this value and move up the art by this amount to give it some weight at the bottom? ask diane

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this (saving movements). must ask backend what they think about this 
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values
