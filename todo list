important tasks:
- entry card update (css/html)
- cover photo (waiting for rachel)
- matte math for weighted bottom
- info card update (css)

medium importance:
- create loading screen
  - gallery can be slow to load, we can use a three js function to count loaded textures while camera does a 360 so that its smooth by the time you get in

waiting:
- ask frontend about outside sim editing (waiting on API)
  - saving json stuff, see below (waiting on API)

future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- how to incorporate with existing website. I think vaughan/donnie will know something about this but i feel bad about asking him how to do this

RAMBLING NOTES:

math:: [size of matte - height of art] / 4
take this value and move up the art by this amount to give it some weight at the bottom? ask diane

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this (saving movements). must ask backend what they think about this 
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values
