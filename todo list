important tasks:
- entry card update
- cover photo (ask diane for picture, or go take some with dslr from library)
- matte math for weighted bottom
- ask frontend about outside sim editing
- info card update
- saving json stuff, see below
- fix the event listener problem

medium importance:
- create loading screen


future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- how to incorporate with existing website. I think vaughan will know something about this but i feel bad about asking him how to do this

bugs:
- fix shift movement bug
- for custom position: fix on click viewing y value (possibly do not fix?)

RAMBLING NOTES:

math:: [size of matte - height of art] / 4
take this value and move up the art by this amount to give it some weight at the bottom? ask diane

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this (saving movements). must ask backend what they think about this 
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values

user options
- flooring options

NOTES:

frames:
- the frames are set to be a bit larger than originally intended. may remove when there is actual art from the collection, but it fits better like this for now
- theres a thing at the bottom of Frames.js that has some math for moving the frames in a logical way to move them to the correct y position, but need to know if that works with custom positions, which means that there needs to be another json (or rather, we could make a single wall check this) 

custom position:
- there are no safety bounds for this, and to be honest i dont feel like adding them because i feel like it should be 'on the student' whether or not they checked before turning in
