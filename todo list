curator vs public view
save data back to json { positions, mattes, frames, lighting, changes in desc }

frames:
move function from Main.js to Frames.js
change all hardcoded values into values from json
  - probably will have to do in Art.js and just send over as arguments

new note: the frames are now fit the exact size of an image. may have to revert this. if a matte is like 16x20, then the frame will be like 17x21 and fit the entire image

the plan: make the frame as if it is in the middle of the room
then, append it as child to a picture
when picture is moved to a wall, the frame should be moved
this *in theory* should work

addtionally: delete the garbage code from main that has the frame generation

once this is done, we can make mattes
mattes should be easy. We can just use the size of the frame and put the matte behind a picture
IF THIS CANNOT be the case: plan: make planes similar to what frames does

lighting? this part is going to suck. I don't know what to do here. 

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this

once things can be changed, we should take all these values and update the json (which also means we need to send back the json so that it can be saved?)
