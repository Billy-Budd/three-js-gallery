info cards
curator vs public view


important tasks:
- click + good photo viewing position
- entry card update
- cover photo (ask diane for picture, or go take some with dslr from library)
- matte math for weighted bottom
- finalize json with new stuff and reflect in artdata.js
- ask frontend about outside sim editing
- info card update
- lighting, see notes below (moreso, make more lights that are weaker??)
- saving json stuff, see below

medium importance:
- make json test all cases for frame generation
- make json test all cases for art position (default and custom positions)
- show different color mattes
- show different color frames
- remove images.border.matte.present value, doesnt do anything

future stuff:
- curator vs public view
- how to incorporate with existing website. I think vaughan will know something about this but i feel bad about asking him how to do this
frames:


RAMBLING NOTES:

math:: [size of matte - height of art] / 4
take this value and move up the art by this amount to give it some weight at the bottom? ask diane

lighting? this part is going to suck. I don't know what to do here. 
 - ask diane about this. can we just do 4 spotlights? or maybe we can do one for each photo. this is going to be like another 2 hours of work or something :((((

Once these things are done, we need a way that a frame, matte, image desc, image placement can be moved inside the simulation. this needs to require curator view, need to ask backend team how we can do this
 - we will need a way server side to do this. must ask backend what they think about this 
 - we can move it all we want in the sim, but there is no way to save these values

user options
- flooring options

NOTES:

new note: the frames are set to be a bit larger than originally intended. may remove when there is actual art from the collection, but it fits better like this for now

theres a thing at the bottom of Frames.js that has some math for moving the frames in a logical way to move them to the correct y position, but need to know if that works with custom positions, which means that there needs to be another json (or rather, we could make a single wall check this)
